    "\n",
    "The SAT scores determine the education quality of a school. There has been lots of effort in the US for education equality. Using the SAT score of New York City, the results of the education policy for education equity will be examined. The data is collected from public schools in the 2014-15 school year with variables such as race, the average score of different categories of the exam, and region in NYC. The levelled education will have a low to no gap between the scores. A confidence interval of 95% will be used to examine the SAT result data. The result will determine if the policies were helpful for a better education environment. If the null hypothesis, stating there is no difference in SAT scores between regions, the NYC Department of Education has successfully made the education equity. They may continue with the existing policy. On the other hand, if significant differences were shown, new approaches will be required.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT is a standardized test used for university admission in the United States (Khandelwal, 2021). It stands for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which measures essential skills required for academic success (Schalkwyk, 2011). High school students typically take the SAT for admissions to universities in the US. The score of students represents the education quality of each school. The difference in the average score of SAT between schools indirectly indicates that there exists a difference in education quality. The SAT scores gap occurred due to the racial discrepancies, poverty and the region they live in, such as Manhattan, Bronx, or Brooklyn. To reduce the education gap, the government has worked for a better environment for all students to learn. The students also participated in strikes and took action to make a difference in education (Conley, 2019). They argue that the students should not be limited to get education on race, sex, religion, or disability (Conley, 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "SAT scores can be used to examine how education equality has been accomplished while the education department in NYC worked for improvement. The research question is: Was the current effort effective enough to reduce the education quality? If it was more successful, the average score between different regions or races should have a lower score gap. The data that will be used is from Kaggle, `Average SAT Scores for NYC Public Schools`. It is from the 2014-15 school year.  It includes various variables such as school name, city, phone number, student enrollment, percent White, Black, Hispanic and Asian, and average score (SAT Math, Reading, and Writing). \n",
    "\n",
    "The education department but also the students tried for improvement for education equity. The hypothesis is that education equity is accomplished in NYC. The SAT score between regions will not be significant anymore. The SAT result data will be explored to test the hypothesis using the given variables. The result will be essential to examine if the government will need a new policy or continue with the current policy for a better learning environment."

Only a few students can achieve the extremely high or low score given that the same education is done to all students in NYC.\n",

The equation is $Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i + U_i$ for $i=1,2,...,n$. The error term, $U_i$ are independent random variable. The expectation of the error term is 0 and the variance will be $\\sigma^2$. $\\alpha$ represents the intercept and $\\beta$ represents the slope.\n",

If there's a strong correlation (both positive and negative), it indicates that race is one of the factors that determine the education level. In this case, rather than dividing into the different regions, the entire NYC will be observed with total SAT scores. The data provides four different races, and the linear regression will be done four times.\n"

    "From the result of linear regression, the education levelling has not done a great job of reducing the education gap between the races. The slopes were either positive or negative, that the SAT average score distribution was highly dependent on the racial demographics. From this section, the conclusion is that the improvement in NYC education is still required.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's goal was to examine if NYC had improved on education equity for all the students who attend the public school in NYC. The evaluation was done with the average scores of SAT from public school. Some schools did not provide enough information for the entire SAT average score. Therefore, they were not considered in the data. The null hypothesis that education's equity is accomplished, various methods were used to test the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Weakness\n",
    "The first method was the Bayesian Credible interval with a confidence of 95%. The goal was to find the interval that has more than 200 schools that are over the mean. Therefore, the interval for 95% is (0.452, 0.548). The probability of having half of the schools with higher scores than the mean is between 0.452 and 0.548. However, the method's weakness is that the assumption was made that the prior distribution was beta distribution without the exact prove. This result may not be exact, while the strong assumption for prior distribution was made. According to this method's result, NYC seems to accomplished education equity in 2014-15.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method was the goodness of fit test. The actual data was used to examine if the data fit the binomial distribution, with the probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The mean of SAT US-wide was used to see the overall NYC performance compared to the other regions outside NYC. The mean of NYC's SAT score was used to know the education distribution within NYC. The Chi-squared test was being used in the section. The conducted null hypothesis is that the SAT score data comes from a binomial distribution. The alternative hypothesis is that the data does not come from a binomial distribution. Therefore, NYC did not perform enough to satisfy the overall education equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third method was the hypothesis test of the mean. The mean of Manhattan was compared with the school in Bronx's mean score. The null hypothesis was that the mean of Manhattan's SAT is the same as the random Bronx's mean of SAT $H_0: \\mu_b = \\mu_m$. The alternative hypothesis was that they do not equal to each other. $H_0: \\mu_b \\neq \\mu_m$. There was no evidence found to reject the null hypothesis because the p-value was significantly large. It indicates that the average SAT scores in the Bronx and Manhattan are the same (similar). From this simulation, it can be found that at least two cities in NYC are obtaining a similar level of education. The weakness is that the results of a hypothesis test are based on probabilities.  For example, the null hypothesis was not rejected in this section. However, if the simulation could be biased and not representative of the population, then simulated data may not represent the population, which may cause type 2 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth method was the confidence interval. The empirical bootstrap method was used. It drew 1000 bootstrap samples of size n with replacement from the original SAT score sample. The confidence interval of 95% was that the mean of the SAT score is between 1240.779 and 1315.121. However, the population average of the US in total was 1497 in the same school year (Anderson, 2014). The whole confidence interval is below the US total mean. Therefore, NYC overall has a lower score of SAT. The weakness is that the test does not produce a numeric measure of the degree of significance and indicates whether P is more or less than 0.05. Also, bootstrapping depends on the representative sample. If the sample schools had a biased score, likely, the result is also biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth method was maximum likelihood estimator calculation. The assumption was that if equity has been successfully accomplished, there will be a normal distribution of the SAT score. The likelihood function and the maximum likelihood estimator were found using the normal distribution. The SAT score is most likely to occur at the mean of 1275.907. The mean of NYC is slightly lower than the worldwide SAT average score, which was 1497. Thus, the department of education in NYC should increase the quality of education of the overall NYC public school for overall better results. The weakness was that the distribution was estimated as the normal distribution, which may not be correct. If the distribution set was wrong, the entire calculation might be wrong. Therefore, choosing the density function carefully would be the most crucial step for an accurate result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method was the linear regression method. It was used to examine the race demographics. If the race's score is affected, it would have a positive or negative slope rather than a flat slope. As a result, the slopes of scores in all the races were either positive or negative, that the SAT average score distribution was highly dependent on the racial demographics. Therefore, the equity of education in the race was not accomplished yet in NYC. The weakness of this method is assuming the linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables. They may have a non-linear relationship. Therefore, it might sometimes lead to making the incorrect or irrelevant relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "NYC Department of education should adjust the policy first while the current results did not satisfy the education equity. In the future, after adjusting the education policy, the data from the same schools can be collected again. It would be best to have a term of 2 years so that the new education can settle down and be effective in students' performance. Then, using the same six methods, the tests can be conducted again. The analysis can be done in precisely the same way how it was done this project. If it indicates that NYC has overall the better mean and no gaps between the regions, it can be considered that the new policy was more helpful than the current policy. Then, it should keep going with the new guidelines. However, if the results worsen, NYC should decide to return to the current policy or make improvements once again."

    "## Discussion \n",
    "Overall, NYC did not accomplish the education equity enough. Therefore, the NYC education department will need a better policy for a higher quality of education. NYC should aim to reduce the difference of score due to the racial disparity. The racial demographic should not affect the quality of the education that the students can get. Also, the overall NYC education quality should be improved. It would be best to have a similar mean with the overall US-wide SAT score. The gap between the NYC mean and the US-wide mean should be reduced. Lastly, the gap within the NYC region should be reduced. Even though the two largest cities, Manhattan and Bronx, did not have differences, the improvements should continue to be made so that all the cities do not have differences in education quality. While having the education is all students' right, it would be best to provide a high quality of education."
